To test this application using Cheyenne, place the binary in this directory, make it executable and run. It should be run from this directory so as to find the `httpd.cfg`.

Note: the CGI script in `../cgi-bin` should be set up first (in that folder, do `cp library.txt library.cgi` and make any edits).
